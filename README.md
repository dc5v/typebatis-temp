# Typebatis

I writing queries more convenient than using an ORM.

While ORMs are like the Swiss Army knife of data access, when it comes to complex queries, they can sometimes feel like using a fork to eat soup.

Additionally, relying solely on ORMs can occasionally result in colleagues who think SQL is the name of the new intern.

Therefore, I've been considering using dynamic queries, similar to how Mybatis is used in Java. Because sometimes, you just need a ladle to handle the soup!


See test.ts :))
